"""
MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoints for ChatGPT integration - Refactored

This module now delegates to focused handler modules for better maintainability.
The original 991-line file has been split into specialized modules:
- event_handlers.py: Event CRUD operations
- search_handlers.py: Search and date parsing
- sync_handlers.py: Sync operations
- protocol_handlers.py: Main router and response formatting

Phase 2 Complete: 991 lines â†’ 27 lines (97% reduction)
